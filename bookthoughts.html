    <td>I read this book because I was diagnosed with ADHD, and I hope it will help me better understand my diagnosis. I thought that the book brought out some 
    very great points. I really like how it talks about structure improving the regulation of  ADHD symptoms. This book was written in 1995, so they used the term Attention Deficit Disorder instead of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
  Iâ€™m actually curious about the terminology change and plan to research that.</td>
